# Progress: Study Quiz App

## What Works

- ✅ Image capture functionality
- ✅ Question generation UI
- ✅ Quiz interface
- ✅ Results display
- ✅ Containerization with Docker
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- ✅ Cloud Run configuration

## What's Left to Build

- ⬜ Implement actual Google Cloud Vision API integration (currently using mock data)
- ⬜ Implement actual OpenAI API integration (currently using mock data)
- ⬜ Add error handling for API failures
- ⬜ Improve mobile responsiveness
- ⬜ Add loading states and animations
- ⬜ Implement analytics for usage tracking
- ⬜ Add support for different quiz types
- ⬜ Implement feedback mechanism for question quality

## Current Status

The application is currently in a functional state with mock data. The deployment infrastructure is now set up, allowing for automated deployment to Google Cloud Run via GitHub Actions. The next phase will focus on integrating the actual APIs and improving the user experience.

## Known Issues

- The application currently uses mock data instead of actual API calls
- Camera functionality may not work in all browsers
- No persistent storage of quiz results
- Limited error handling for API failures

## Recent Milestones

- ✅ Set up Docker containerization
- ✅ Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- ✅ Update Next.js configuration for containerization
- ✅ Create deployment documentation

## Upcoming Milestones

- ⬜ First successful deployment to Cloud Run
- ⬜ Integration with actual Google Cloud Vision API
- ⬜ Integration with actual OpenAI API
- ⬜ User testing and feedback collection
