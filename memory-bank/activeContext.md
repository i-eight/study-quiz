# Active Context: Study Quiz App

## Current Focus

The current focus is on setting up the deployment infrastructure for the Study Quiz App to Google Cloud Run. This includes:

1. Creating a Dockerfile for containerizing the application
2. Setting up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Configuring the necessary environment variables and secrets
4. Documenting the deployment process

## Recent Changes

- Added Dockerfile for containerizing the Next.js application
- Updated next.config.js to enable standalone output mode for optimal containerization
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment to Google Cloud Run
- Added deployment documentation

## Active Decisions

- **Deployment Strategy**: Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD to Google Cloud Run
- **Container Registry**: Using Google Artifact Registry for storing Docker images
- **Environment Variables**: Storing sensitive information as GitHub Secrets
- **Region Selection**: Deploying to asia-northeast1 region for optimal performance in Asia

## Current Considerations

- **Cost Optimization**: Cloud Run's pay-per-use model should be cost-effective for this application
- **Cold Start Performance**: Monitoring needed to ensure acceptable startup times
- **Security**: Ensuring all API keys and credentials are properly secured
- **Scalability**: Cloud Run will automatically scale based on traffic

## Next Steps

- Test the deployment pipeline with a sample commit
- Monitor the application performance in the cloud environment
- Consider setting up monitoring and alerting
- Explore options for custom domain configuration
