# Study Quiz App - Project Intelligence

## Project Structure
- Next.js application with API routes
- React components in `/components` directory
- API routes in `/app/api` directory
- Utility functions in `/src` directory
- Deployment configuration in `.github/workflows`

## Deployment Workflow
- The application is containerized using Docker
- GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD to Google Cloud Run
- Environment variables are stored as GitHub Secrets
- The deployment region is asia-northeast1

## Environment Variables
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Required for OpenAI API access
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_QUOTA_PROJECT: Required for Google Cloud Vision API access

## Development Patterns
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing component structure for new features
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use React hooks for state management
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use try/catch blocks for error handling

## Testing Locally
- Run `npm run dev` for local development
- Use Docker for testing the containerized application
- Check browser console for errors
- Test on multiple devices and browsers when possible

## Deployment Testing
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow for successful deployment
- Check Cloud Run logs for any issues
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Test the application functionality after deployment

## Common Issues
- Cold start latency in Cloud Run
- API rate limits for OpenAI and Google Cloud Vision
- Camera API compatibility across browsers
- Image size and quality affecting text extraction

## User Preferences
- Clear and simple UI
- Fast response times
- Accurate question generation
- Helpful feedback on quiz results
